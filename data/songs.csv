A winter's day, in a deep and dark december;
Am D7  C   G Am            hm     Am               hm
I am alone, gazing from my window to the streets below

On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow.
C      G     C       D7 G
I Am A Rock, I am an island.


           G        C                 G
I've built walls, a fortress deep and mighty,
    Am D7     C   G        Am              hm
That none may penetrate. I have no need of friendship;
Am                hm         Am                C           D
Friendship causes pain. It's laughter and it's loving I disdain.
C      G     C       D7 G
I Am A Rock, I am an island.


              G              C                 G
Don't talk of love, but I've heard the words before;
     Am       D7    C   G     Am                hm         Am
It's sleeping in my memory. I won't disturb the slumber of feelings
          hm         Am            C                D
That have died. If I never loved I never would have cried.
C      G     C       D7 G
I Am A Rock, I am an island.


          G             C            G
I have my books, and my poetry to protect me;
     Am   D7     C    G    Am           hm    Am             hm
I am shielded in my armor, hiding in my room, save within my womb.
  Am                 C              D
I touched no one and no one touches me.
C      G     C       D7 G
I Am A Rock, I am an island.


      Am   D7       G
And a rock feels no pain;
       Am     D7    G
And an island never cries!","2025-03-23 19:54:11","2025-03-23 19:54:11",176

And combed his dark hair down
And his mother cried as he walked out;

Leave your guns at home, Bill
Don't Take Your Guns To Town

He rode into a cattle town, a smile upon his lips
He stopped and walked into a bar and laid his money down
But his mother's words echoed again;

Refrain:
He drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hand
And tried to tell himself at last he had become a man
A dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down
And he heard again his mother's words

Refrain:
Bill was raged and Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw
But the stranger drew his gun and fired before he even saw
As Billy Joe fell to the floor the crowd all gathered 'round
And wondered at his final words;

Some dance to remember some dance to forget
So I called up the captain please bring me my wine he said
We have´nt seen that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night just to hear them say

Mirrors on the ceiling pink champagne on ice and she said
We are all just prisoners here of our own device
And in the masters chambers we are gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives but they just can´t kill the beast
Last thing I remember I was running for the door
Had to find the passage back to the place I was before

Like my father before me, I work the land.
And like my brother above me, who took a rebel stand.
He was just eighteen, proud and brave,
But a Yankee laid him in his grave.
I swear my the mud below my feet,
You can't raise the cane back up when it's in the feed.

I wouldn't pay it any mind,
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.

Take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind.
Down the foggy ruins of time,
far past the frozen leaves,
The haunted frightened trees,
Out to the windy bench,
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
Yes to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Silhouetted by the sea,
Circled deep beneath the waves,
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.","2025-03-23 19:54:11","2025-03-23 19:54:11",181

Started out all alone 
And the sun went down as I crossed the hill, 
And the town lit up, the world got still 


I'm learning to fly, but I ain't got wings 
Coming down is the hardest thing. 


Well the good ol' days may not return, 
And the rocks might melt and the sea may burn 


I'm learning to fly, but I ain't got wings 
Coming down is the hardest thing 


Well, some say life will beat you down, 
Break your heart, steal your crown 
So I've started out for God knows where, 
I guess I'll know when I get there 


I'm learning to fly, but I ain't got wings 
Coming down is the hardest thing

i'm gonna rock the Mike til you cant resist
everybody, i say it goes like this
well i was comin home late one dark afternoon
a reporter stopped me for a interview
she said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
that i'm vicious on the Mike and the turntables
this young reporter i did adore
so i rocked a vicious rhyme like i never did before
she said damn fly guy im in love with you
the casanova legend must have been true
i said by the way baby what's your name
said i go by the name of Lois Lane
and you could be my boyfiend you surely can
just let me quit my boyfriend called superman
i said he's a fairy i do suppoose
flyin through the air in pantyhose
he may be very sexy or even cute
but he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit
i said you need a man who's got finesse
and his whole name across his chest
he may be able to fly all through the night
but can he rock a party til the early light?
he cant satisfy you with his little worm
but i can bust you out with my super sperm
i go do it, i go do it, i go do it, do it , do it
an i'm here an i'm there i'm big bang Hank, i'm everywhere

everybody go hotel motel holiday inn
you say if your girl starts actin up then you take her friend
i say skip, dive, what can i say
i cant fit em all inside my oj
so i just take half and bust them out
i give the rest to master gee so he could shock the house

It was twelve o'clock one friday night
i was rockin to the beat and feelin all right 
everybody was dancin on the floor
doin all the things they never did before
and then this fly fly girl with a sexy lean
she came into the bar, she came into the scene
as she traveled deeper inside the room
all the fellas checked out her white sasoons
she came up to the table, looked into my eyes
then she turned around and shook her behind
so i said to myself, its time for me to release
my vicious rhyme i call my masterpiece 
and now people in the house this is just for you
a little rap to make you boogaloo
now the group ya hear is called phase two
and let me tell ya somethin we're a helluva crew
once a week we're on the street

for you to party ya got to have the movies
so we'll get right down and give you the groove
for you to dance you gotta get hype
so we'll get right down for you tonight
now the system's on and the girls are there
ya definitely have a rockin affair
but let me tell ya somethin there's still one fact
that to have a party ya got to have a rap
so when the party's over you're makin it home
and tryin to sleep before the break of dawn
and while ya sleepin ya start to dream
and thinkin how ya danced on the disco scene
my name appears in your mind
yeah, a name you know that was right on time
it was phase two just a doin a do
rockin ya down cause ya know we could
to the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak
come alive girls get on your feet
to the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat
to the double beat beat that it makes ya freak
to the rhythm of the beat that says ya go on
on n on into the break of dawn
now i got a man comin on right now
he's guaranteed to throw down
he goes by the name of wonder Mike
come on wonder Mike do what ya like

like a can of beer that's sweeter than honey
like a millionaire that has no money
like a rainy day that is not wet
like a gamblin fiend that does not bet
like dracula with out his fangs
like the boogie to the boogie without the boogie bang
like collard greens that dont taste good
like a tree that's not made out of wood
like goin up and not comin down
is just like the beat without the sound no sound
to the beat beat, ya do the freak
everybody just rock and dance to the beat
have you ever went over a friends house to eat
and the food just aint no good
i mean the macaroni's soggy the peas are mushed
and the chicken tastes like wood
so you try to play it off like you think you can
by sayin that youre full
and then your friend says momma he's just being polite
he aint finished uh uh that's bull
so your heart starts pumpin and you think of a lie
and you say that you already ate
and your friend says man there's plenty of food
so you pile some more on your plate
while the stinky foods steamin your mind starts to dreamin
of the moment that it's time to leave
and then you look at your plate and your chickens slowly rottin
into something that looks like cheese
oh so you say that's it i got to leave this place
i dont care what these people think
im just sittin here makin myself nauseous
with this ugly food that stinks
so you bust out the door while its still closed
still sick from the food you ate
and then you run to the store for quick relief
from a bottle of kaopectate
and then you call your friend two weeks later
to see how he has been
and he says i understand about the food
baby bubbah but we're still friends
with a hip hop the hippie to the hippie
the hip hip a hop a you dont stop the rockin
to the bang bang boogie
say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie the beat
i say hank can ya rock 
can ya rock to the rhythm that just dont stop
can ya hip me to the shoobie doo
i said come on make the make the people move

I go to the halls and then ring the bell
because i am the man with the clientele
and if ya ask me why i rock so well
a big bang, i got clientele
and from the time i was only six years old
i never forgot what i was told
it was the best advice that i ever had
it came from my wise dear old dad
he said sit down punk i wanna talk to you
and dont say a word until i'm through
now there's a time to laugh a time to cry
a time to live and a time to die
a time to break and a time to chill
to act civilized or act real ill
but whatever ya do in your lifetime
ya never let a mc steal your rhyme
so from sixty six til this very day
ill always remember what he had to say
so when the sucker mcs try to chump my style
i let them know that i'm versatile
i got style finesse and a little black book
that's filled with rhymes and i know you wanna look
but there's a thing that separates you from me
and that's called originality
because my rhymes are on from what you heard
i didnt even bite and not a god d--m word
and i say a little more later on tonight
so the sucker mc's can bite all night
a tick a tock yall a beat beat yall

Came creeping all across the nation
I tell you people, I was not ready
When I fucked this dyke by the name of Freddy

uuh, she tried to make me say when
She had my balls in a vice, but she left the dick
I guess it's still hooked on but now it shoots too quick

   Oh God I am the american dream

   I'm a miserable son of a bitch
   Am I a boy or a lady, I don't know which
     ( I wonder, wonder, I wonder, wonder)
  
So I went out and bought me a leisure suit
I jingle my change, but I'm still kinda cute
Got a job doing radio promo
And none of the jocks can even tell I'm a homo

Eventually me and a friend
Sort of drifted along into S&M
I can take about an hour on the tower of power
As long as I gets a little golden shower

   Oh God, I am the american dream
   With a spindle up my butt 'till it makes me scream
   And I'll do anything to get ahead

And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag 
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch.
And it's knowing I'm not shackled 
By forgotten words and bonds 
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you in the backroads by the rivers of my memory 
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind. 

It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy planted
On their columns now that binds me. 
Or something that somebody said because they thought 
We fit together walkin'. 
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing or forgiving 
When I walk along some railroad track and find 
That you're moving on the backroads by the rivers of my memory 
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind. 

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines 
And the junkyards and the highways come between us. 
And some other woman crying to her mother 
'Cause she turned and I was gone. 
I still might run in silence, tears of joy might stain my face 
And a summer sun might burn me till I'm blind. 
But not to where I cannot see you walkin' on the backroads 
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind. 

I dip my cup of soup, back from the gurgling cracklin' cauldron 
In some train yard 
My beard a roughning coal pile and a dirty hat 
Pulled low across my face. 
Through cupped hands 'round a tin can 
I pretend I hold you to my breast and find 
That you're waving from the backroads by the rivers of my memory 
Ever smilin' ever gentle on my mind.

And our love become a funeral pyre

så er det den at ingenting er dit

For de står selv for skyld som ejer lov og ret
og de burde dømmes. Lig' nu er du så træt
men alle deres sønner og døtre ligeså

Du er ikke alene...

Det er en historie der handler om en dreng
Mange år er gået siden dengang da han boede
Her på gården Katfred i byen Lønneberg

Emil var navnet som han bar ? Emil ja husk det nu

Op i Katfreds flagstang hejste han sin lille søster
I kan vel forstå at der blev en stor ståhej

Uhadada så slem han var ? men Ida var så kry
Og ingen anden svævet har så højt i vores by

Nu skal jeg fortælle om den dag da vi fik suppe
Og Emil sit hoved stak i terrinen ned
Hen til doktoren måtte vor Emil og tænk terrinen
Sad om hovedet fastklemt hvor meget vi end sled

Uhadada så slem han var ? for I forstår jo godt
Man ikke i terrinen har plads til en slikkepot

Venner det er ikke alt jeg når jer at fortælle
For Emil ku? lave spilopper dagen lang
Han blev sat i snedkerboden for at blive artig
Husk det I som sidder og lytter til min sang

I småland aldrig nogen har gjort så meget galt

Me & my friend were walking
In the cold light of mourning.
Tears may blind the eyes but the soul is not deceived
In this world even winter ain't not what it seems.

When the rivers run high & the tears run dry.
When everything that dies.
Shall rise.

In our lives we hunger for those we cannot touch.
All the thoughts unuttered & all the feelings unexpressed
Play upon our hearts like the mist upon our breath.
But, awoken by grief, our spirits speak
""How could you believe that the life within the seed
that grew arms that reached
And a heart that beat.
And lips that smiled
And eyes that cried.
Could ever die?""

Here come the blue skies Here comes springtime.

Ran out of time and money, looks like they took my friends.

Somewhere I lost connections, ran out of songs to play,
I came in to town a one night stand, looks like my plans fell though.

148,"Erik Oluf Andersen","Erik Oluf Andersen har hængt sig i en lund, 
han har vel haft en ganske særlig grund, 
det er trods alt en gåde, hvordan dette kunne ske, 
hvad var det som fik Andersen på såd´n en skør ide. 
 
Der var ingen ydre tegn, der viste hvor´n det lå, 
man må vel la´ sig nøje med, at sådan kan det gå. 
For Andersens hustru hun var både sød og rar, 
og sønnen i familien var et mønstereksemplar, 
de bo´de i en kæmpevilla i et fint kvarter, 
jo, lykken smiled´ til ham, han ku´ næppe ønske mer´. 
 
Det hele started´ med et lille bolsjekogeri, 
han kogte nat og dag og glemte helt at holde fri, 
men virksomheden voksed´ han blev snart en holden mand, 
han købte sig en luksusvogn der svared´ til hans stand. 

Fru Andersen tog tit til byen med sin kontokort, 
hun parkerede sin egen bil ved varehusets port, 
der købte hun hvad hun fik lyst til, intet blev forsømt, 
og når hun kørte hjem igen var varehuset tømt. 

De havde køleskab og fryseboks som altid var fyldt op 
og svinelædermøbler, kvaliteten var i top, 
motorbåd og sommerhus med bar og åben pejs, 
der slapped´ fruen af i ny og næ med sin filejs. 

Men Erik Oluf Andersen han tog familiens hund, 
og gik en tur en dejlig aftenstund, 
hunden kom tilbage, der var blot et lille men, 
Erik Oluf Andersen kom aldrig hjem igen. 

Siden blev han fundet i en lund ved Snekkersten, 
der hang den stakkels Andersen og dingled´ fra en gren. 
Aldrig mer´ skal Andersen hæve sin pokal, 
når han har givet middag i hotellets store sal, 
festen den er slut, det hele endte med et brag, 
og en hel flok aktionærer fik et ord´ntligt nakkedrag. 
 
For lykken havde vendt sig sådan som det ofte sker, 
hans firma gik af helved´ til, han lånte mer og mer, 
for sent kom han i tanke om at gi´ den en spand kul, 
for at redde sig i land og fylde gældens dybe hul. 
 
Så han knoklede for livet ofte flere døgn i træk, 
han rationaliserede men skuden den var læk, 
og der si´s at han til slut har strøet om sig vidt og bredt 
med gældsbeviser, og han har også spillet på roulet. 
 
Men regningerne voksede til en stadig større stak, 
så Erik Oluf Andersen han sa´ farvel og tak, 
og i den skønne aftenstund der rejste han af sted, 
mod fjerne horisonter for at finde ro og fred. 

Erik Oluf Andersen har hængt sig i en gren 
lad os andre læse på hans sten: 
Her hviler E. O. Andersen - et offer for vor tid 
distancen var for hård og konkurrencen var for strid.

Tred´ve år før tiden gik han gennem dødens port. 
Brødet han slog op var alt for stort. ","2025-03-23 19:54:11","2025-03-23 19:54:11",275

The first thing you do when you get up out of bed

Is hit that street a-runnin' and try to meet the masses

I spot a little thing and I followed her all night
In a funky pair of levis and her sweater's kind of tight
She had a west coast strut that was as sweet as molases
But what really knocked me out was her cheap sunglasses
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah (with Rhythm 2)

Now go out and get yourself some big black frames
With the glass so dark thay won't even know your name
And the choice is up to you cause they come in two classes
Rhinestone shades and cheap sunglasses

Han rejste med sorg fra sin unge brud

O Marie jeg vil hjem til dig o.s.v. 

Han længes hjem igen til den gamle gård
I tjensten sker der meget  som han ikke forstår
Til alt hvad han har lyst til får han ikke lov
Han længes hjem til marken og den blanke plov

På den sergent der kommer gi,r han ikke agt

208,"Pigen med det solsort-sorte hår","Lige uden for byen dér hvor husene slår over i land
Lå der engang en Shell-tank
Der nær havde gjort mig til en mand
Det står så klart som i aftes – det står så klart som i går
At jeg gjorde mig til grin for pigen
Med det solsort-sorte hår

Jeg kom kørende fra Bindslev
Med noget grus jeg havde købt af en mand
Jeg sku’ ryge men jeg manglede en lighter
Og holdt ind for at købe sådan én
Da jeg stod i butikken og jeg så hende
Blev jeg skræmt som en tævet hund
Så jeg kom til at lette på min træsko
Og tømme den ud for lidt sand
Jeg hørte hun lavede sådan et smask med munden
Og kiggede ned på mine fødder
Det blev den eneste gang jeg så pigen
Med det solsort-sorte hår

Jeg skyndte mig at sige – en lighter tak 
Og stirrede ned på mine penge
Jeg ku’ mærke hun kiggede surt på mig
Jeg syntes det varede så længe
Da jeg kom ud ku’ jeg se gennem vinduet
Et kvindemenneske der bøjede sig ned
Og fejede sand op efter et møgsvin
Det var pigen med det solsort-sorte hår

Jeg kørte derfra med mit grus i en fart
Jeg forsvandt så hurtigt jeg ku’
Åh sådan et fjols jeg havde været - og så klodset - åh Gud
Jeg pinte mig selv helt til Brønderslev 
Jeg forbandede hvad jeg havde gjort
Eller måske ku’ jeg bare ikke glemme pigen
Med det solsort-sorte hår

Så en dag jeg skulle ind til Hjørring 
Ind til lægen og ha’ set på en byld
Jeg holdt ind i Harken
Og købte chokolade med kirsebærfyld
Jeg vidste med mig selv jeg måtte ind og beklage
Mit svineri og nu sku’ det være - og gi’ chokoladen
Til pigen med det solsort-sorte hår

Jeg svingede ind på pladsen
Hvor butikken plejede at ligge
Men der var ingen Shell-tank mere
Og ingen butik at se
I stedet for en Shell-tank
Var der kommet noget der hed Jet
Bare en stor gul plade nogen havde smidt
På sådan et par stivere hen over en nat
Og nogle standere på et nøgent vindblæst hjørne
Der gabte som et åbent sår
Men ikke så meget som skyggen af pigen
Med det solsort-sorte hår

Jeg er ikke romantisk
Nok nærmest en fremskridts-mand
Hvis det ikke ka’ gå må det ramle
Jeg er sådan set ligeglad
Men jeg skal aldrig ind og tanke mit diesel
Om rabatten er nok så stor
Hvor folk er for nærige til at ansætte pigen

And if you can?t recall the singer you can still recall the tune.
Dry your eyes and play it slowly like you?re marching off to war;
Sing it like you know he?d want it, like we sang it once before.
And from the center of the circle to the midst of the waiting crowd,
If it ever be forgotten sing it long and sing it loud and come dry your eyes.

And he taught us more about giving than we ever cared to know,
But we came to find the secret and we never let it go.
And it was more than being holy and it was less than being free,
And if you can?t recall the reason can you hear the people sing.
Right through the lightning and the thunder to the dark side of the moon,
To that distant falling angel that descended much too soon
And come dry your eyes.

drøned´ plud´lig ud af tågen, 
fløj af sted mod toppen som et skud

tak ska´ du ha´ hvor bøtten vendte 
sikke en masse folk han kendte

Klap på ryggen hele røgen

men lærte snart hvordan man meler kagen.

And you think you're so clever and classless and free
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see
A working class hero is something to be

There's room at the top they are telling you still
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill
If you want to be like the folks on the hill

And their kids are hippie chicks and hypocrites
Because fashion is smashin' the true meaning of it

Without you by my side.

Just thinking how you'd done me wrong.
I grew strong.
I learned how to get along.

Without that look upon your face.
I should have changed my fucking lock.
I would have made you leave your key
If I'd have known for just one second
You'd be back to bother me.

Walk out the door.
Just turn around now.

I know I'll be alive.

It took all the strength I had
Just not to fall apart.
I'm trying hard to mend
The pieces of my broken heart.
And I spent oh so many nights
Just feeling sorry for myself.
I used to cry.
But now I hold my head up high. 

And you'll see me with somebody new.
I'm not that stupid little person
Still in love with you.
And so you thought you'd just drop by,
And you expect me to be free.
But now I'm saving all my lovin'
For someone who's lovin' me.

Birdland on 53, the street sounds like a symphony
We got John Coltrane and a love supreme
Miles and she has to be an Angel
Lady Day got diamond eyes
She sees the truth behind the lies (Angel)
Soul love this love won't let me go
So long...Angel of Harlem

[Bridge]
Am      G   F                  Am G             F
ooh ooh ooh ooh she sings with heart, heart and soul

[Verse 3]
Blue light on the avenue
God knows they got to you
An empty glass, the lady sings
Eyes swollen like a bee sting
Blinded you lost your way
On the side streets and the alleyways
Like a star exploding in the night
Filling up the city with broad daylight
An Angel in Devil's shoes
Salvation in the blues
You never looked like an Angel
So long...Angel of Harlem

Good bye to you my thrusted friend,

we`ve known each other since we were nine or ten;

but the hills that we climb were just seasons out of time.


Goodbye papa plees pray for me, I was the blacksheep of the family,'
you tried to teach me right from wrong, too much wine and too much song,
wounder how I got along.
Goodbye papa it`s hard to die, when all the birds are singing in the sky,
now that the spring is in the air,
little children everywere ,
when you see them I'll be there.

We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun,
but the wine and the song like the seasons out of time.

Goodbye Michelle my little one,
you gave me love and helped me find the sun,
and every time that  I was down,
you always come around and
get my feet back on the ground,
Goodbye Michelle it's hard to die,
when all the birds are singing in the sky,
now that the spring is in the air,
whit the flowers everywhere,
I wish that we could both be there.

We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun
but the stars we could reach were just starfish on the beach

You've gone to the finest schools, all right, Miss Lovely,
But you know you only used to get juiced in it.
You never had to live out on the street,
But now you're gonna have to get used to it.
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulders a Siamese cat.
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal.


You never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you.
Never understood that it ain't no good.
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you.
You said you'd never compromise
With the Mystery Tramp but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And he says, ""Do you want to make a deal?""


Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they've got it made.
Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts,
You'd better lift your diamond ring, you'd better pawn it babe.
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now he calls you you can't refuse
When you got nothin' you got nothin' to lose
Your invisible now you've got no secrets to conceal.","2025-03-23 19:54:11","2025-03-23 19:54:11",181

When you left your two fine legs behind 
Or was it walking upon the sea

Stumps of a tree won't do at all

Børge og lille Lasse, Karl Herman og jeg 
var på turne et år, og det gik som en leg. 
Vi tjente kasse nok til et godt lille sted. 
Og der drøned´ vi deruda´, og folk skråled´ med :

El-guitar og saxofon vil vi ha?.

var ble´t lidt grå i toppen, så vi gik hver sin vej. 
Lasse har købt et slot, men han åbner sin dør, 
så spiller vi lidt Mozart præcis li´som før. 

Men på søndag ska´ vi på den igen. 
Børges dreng han fylder atten. 
Vi tre andre stiller op med vor ven,

An old cowboy went riding out one dark and windy day
Am
Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
 
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw
F                                     Am
Plowing through the ragged skies  and up a cloudy draw
 
Am                                        C
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
      Am
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
            
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
       F                                  Am
For he saw the riders coming hard  and he heard their mournful cry
 
        C         Am      F                   Am
Yipie i-oh  Yipie i-ay    ghost riders in the sky
 
Am
Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred
      C
Their shirts all soaked with sweat
     Am
He’s riding hard to catch that herd but he ain't caught 'em yet
 
Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
   F                             Am
On horses snorting fire  as they ride on hear their cry
 
Am                               C
As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name
       Am
If you want to save your soul from hell a riding on our range
 
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
F                                 Am
Trying to catch the devil’s herd  across these endless skies
 
       C           Am    F                   Am
Yipie i-oh  Yipie i-ay   ghost riders in the sky

All those nights when you've got no lights
The check is in the mail
And your little angel
Hung the cat up by it's tail
And your third fiance didn't show

Climbing the walls when no one calls
You've lost at love again
And the more you're down and out
The more you need a friend
When you long to hear a kind hello

Roll out of bed, Mr. Coffee's dead
The morning's looking bright
And your shrink ran off to Europe
And didn't even write
And your husband wants to be a girl

Be glad there's one place in the world
Where Everybody Knows Your Name
And they're always glad you came
You wanna go where people know
People are all the same
You wanna go Where Everybody Knows Your Name

Well now way back in the bible, temptations always come along,
There's always somebody tempted, somebody into doing,
Something that they know is wrong.
They'll tempt you man with silver, and they'll tempt you sir with gold,
And they'll tempt you with the pleasures, that the flesh does surely hold.
They say Eve tempted Adam with an apple, but now I ain't goin' for that...

Well now some folks say that it's too big, uses too much gas,
Some folks say it's too old, and it goes too fast,
But my love is better in a Honda, yeah it's better in a Subaru,
And there is only one thing, only one car that'll do,
Anyway, we don't have to drive it, honey we can park it out back,

And have a party in you Pink Cadillac,
Crushed velvet seats,
Ridin' in the back,
Cruisin' down the street,

En flaske bjæsk fløj gennem rummet, og pluds?lig blev der ro igen; 
al skrål og larm var helt forstummet, da flasken lander oven på Kræn.

But I know what I am and I'm glad that I'm a man

Chorus | C | Am | Fmaj7 |

Is it getting better
or do you feel the same
Will it make it easier on you? 
Now you got someone to blame
You say; One love; One life; When it's one need; in the night
Its one love; we get to share it
It leaves you baby; If you don't care for it
 
Did I disappoint you?
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
and you want me to go without
Well it's too late; tonight;
to drag the past out - into the light
We're one;   but we're not the same;   
we get to carry each other - carry each other - One
 
Have you come here for forgiveness? 
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus?    
To the lepers in your head
Did I ask too much - more than a lot; 
you gave me nothing - now it's all I got
We're one; but we're not the same
well we hurt each other - then we do it again; you say

C                  Am
Love is a temple - Love a higher law

And I can't be holding on, to what you got
Fmaj7                 C
When all you got is hurt
 
One love, one blood, one life; 
you got to do what you should
One life - with each other; 
Sisters - Brothers
One life; But we're not the same
we get to carry each other
Carry each other; one; one","2025-03-23 19:54:11","2025-05-04 12:17:22",139

Den første gang jeg så dig, da lyste sommerskyen
så blændende som svanen i sit skrud.
Da kvitrede fra skoven - fra skovens grønne bryn
ligesom en jubel fugle sang en ud
Da faldt en sang fra himlen ned og hvem kan musicere
smukt som den lille lærke grå – så svær at observere.
Den første gang jeg så dig, da lyste sommerskyen
så blændende og klar som aldrig mere.

Og derfor når jeg ser dig – i vinterens kolde dag,
når sneen dækker jorden som en skal
Så hør’ jeg sommerblæsten og lærkens friske slag
og bølgens brus i alle fulde fag
Så drages sneens tæppe væk fra engen og fra ager
og kløvermarken blir så blød som elskende behager 
og sommersolen skinner på dine ansigts træk
som rødmer og som stråler og betager.","2025-03-23 19:54:11","2025-03-23 19:54:11",269
365,"My Oklahoma Home","When they opened up the strip I was young and full of zip,
I wanted some place to call my own.
And so I made the race, and staked me out a place,
And settled down along the Cimarron.

It blowed away, it blowed away,
My Oklahoma home, it blowed away.
It looked so green and fair when I built my shanty there,
But my Oklahoma home, it blowed away.

I planted wheat and oats, got some chickens and some shoats,
Aimed to have some ham and eggs to feed my face.
Got a mule to pull the plow, got an old red muley cow
And got a fancy mortgage on the place.

It blowed away, it blowed away,
All the crops I planted blowed away.
You can't grow any grain if you ain't got any rain;
All except the mortgage blowed away.

It looked so green and fair, when I built my shanty there,
I figured I was all set for life.
I put on my Sunday best with my fancy scalloped vest
And went to town and picked me out a wife.

She blowed away, she blowed away
My Oklahoma woman blowed away.
Mister as I bent and kissed her, she was picked up by a twister;
My Oklahoma woman blowed away.

Then I was left alone a-listenin' to the moan
Of the wind around the corners of my shack;
So I took off down the road when the south wind blowed,
A-travelin' with the wind at my back.

I blowed away, I blowed away
Chasin' a dust cloud up ahead.
Once it looked so green and fair, now it's up there in the air;
My Oklahoma farm is overhead.

Now I'm always close to home no matter where I roam,
For Oklahoma dust is everywhere.
Makes no difference where I'm walkin', I can hear my chickens squawkin'
I can hear my wife a-talkin' in the air.

It blowed away, it blowed away,
My Oklahoma home blowed away.
But my home is always near; it's in the atmosphere,
My Oklahoma home that blowed away.

I'm a roamin' Oklahoman, but I'm always close to home
And I'll never get homesick 'til I die.
No matter where I'm found, my home is all around;
My Oklahoma home is in the sky.

It blowed away, it blowed away,
My farm down upon the Cimarron.
But all around the world, wherever dust is whirled,
Some is from my Oklahoma home.

It blowed away, it blowed away,
My Oklahoma home blowed away.
Oh it's up there in the sky in that dust cloud rolling by, my Oklahoma home is blowed away.","2025-03-23 19:54:11","2025-03-23 19:54:11",58

Listenin' to the stories that he told

Like a treasured memory from the past

And say child

This here's the Van Lear Rose

Oh how it would bring a smile
When he talked about her big blue eyes
And how her beauty ran down to her soul
She'd walk across the coal miner's yard
Them miner's would yell loud and hard
And they'd dream of who would hold
The Van Lear Rose

She was the belle of Johnson County
     G 
Ohio river to Big Sandy

Talk about the man that came to town

Right under their nose
                                G
Stole the heart of the Van Lear Rose

Now the Van Lear Rose could've had her pick
And all the fellers figured rich
Until this poor boy caught her eye
His buddies would all laugh and say
Your dreamin' boy she'll never look your way
You'll never ever hold the Van Lear Rose

Then one night in mid July
Underneath that ol' blue Kentucky sky
Well, that poor boy won that beauty's heart
Then my daddy would look at my mommy and smile
As he brushed the hair back from my eyes and he'd say
Your mama
She's the Van Lear Rose

Now for ten years we´ve been on our own 
and moss grows fat on a rolling stone
But that´s not how it used to be 
when the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
 and a voice that came from you and me
Oh and while the king was looking down 
the jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned, no verdict was returned
And while Lennin read a book on Marx 
the quartet practised in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark the day the music died


Helter Skelter in the summer welter
 the birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and fallin´ fast,
 it landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass, 
with the jester on the sidelines in a cast
Now the halftime air was sweet perfume 
while the sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance but we never got the chance 
cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refuse to yield the day the music died


And there we were all in one place,
 a generation lost in space
With no time left to start again, 
so come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick,
 cause fire is the devils only friend
And as I watched him on the stage 
my hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in hell could break that Satan´s spell
And as the flames climbed high into the night
 to light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight the day the music died

G      D/F#      Em                   Am                 C
I met a girl who sang the blues and I asked her for some happy news
    Em                  D
But she just smiled and turned away
G      D/F#        Em                     Am        G/B   C
I went down to the sacred store - where I heard the music years before
        Em                 C              D
But the man there said the music wouldn´t play
    Em                 Am                 
And in the streets the children screamed, 
           Em               Am 
the lovers cried, the poets dreamed
    C       G/B      Am          C                     D
But not one word was spoken, the church bells all were broken
        G     D/F#  Em         G/B       C                    D7
And the three men I admire the most, the Father, Son and Holy Ghost

On a warm summer's evening on a train bound for nowhere
  Bb            F                                  C   
I met up with a gambler. We were both too tired to sleep.
   F                               Bb            F  
So we took turns a starin' out the window at the darkness
     Bb           F          C7          F   
till boredom overtook us and he began to speak.

[Verse 2]
He said, ""Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces
and knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes.
So if you don't mind my sayin' I can see you're out of aces; 
for a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice.""

[Verse 3]
So I handed him my bottle, and he drank doen my last swallow.
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light.
And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression.
Said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy, you gotta learn to play it
right.""

Know when to walk away and know when to run.
          F     Bb   F                 Bb               F 
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.
           Bb              F       C7                 F
Ther'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.""

[Verse 4]
""Ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away and knowin' what to keep.
'Cause ev'ry hand's a winner, and ev'ry hand's a loser.
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.""

[Verse 5]
And when he'd finished speakin' he turned back toward the window.
Crushed ou his cigarette and faded off to sleep.
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler he broke even.
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.","2025-03-23 19:54:11","2025-05-02 14:53:37",254

I am the one
To make you see
Where we belong
I was shaking
Like a leaf
All wrapped up
In my dirty sheets
If I agree to what comes next
I would be faking
With the best of them
It seems a crime
I would commit
Without the difference
Of all the world's gifts 

Sweet sweet sweet
Could you taste it 

Never never never
Never never never
(Taste it) 

To dream
All the time
Without a scream
In the dead of night
All those faces
Come back to me
I'll be begging
To swim that sea 

Yea I made
A picture story
Make you cry
In all your glory
A need to quench
The thirst of many
To justify
And make ready

Could you taste it 

Never never never

Owes us strength to show

You're invited to believe

These are the words I speak 

A dislocation
From where we once came from
Give sons and daughters
Because we want to go on 

These are the words she speaks

It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.


I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pourin' out of a boxcar door,
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won the wars
After losin' every battle.

I woke up on the roadside, daydreamin' 'bout the way things sometimes are
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are makin' me see stars.
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies.
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzin' around your eyes,
Blood on your saddle.

Idiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb,
Blowing through the curtains in your room.
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,
You're an idiot, babe.
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.

It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart
You tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasn't enough to change my heart.
Now everything's a little upside down, as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped,
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top
You're on the bottom.

I noticed at the ceremony, your corrupt ways had finally made you blind
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes
don't look into mine.
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the building 
burned.
I waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees, while the springtime 
turned Slowly into autumn.

Idiot wind, blowing like a circle around my skull,
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol.
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,
You're an idiot, babe.
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.

I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishin' I was somebody else instead.
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
And all your ragin' glory.

I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me.
You'll never know the hurt I suffered nor the pain I rise above,
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness or your kind of love,
And it makes me feel so sorry.

Idiot wind, blowing through the buttons of our coats,
Blowing through the letters that we wrote.
Idiot wind, blowing through the dust upon our shelves,
We're idiots, babe.
It's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.","2025-03-23 19:54:11","2025-03-23 19:54:11",181

Han samler tårer i en spand af guld
Et smykkeskrin begravet i et mægtigt hul
Hvor tyven selv faldt ned så plørefuld
Som i et eventyr

En syndig sjæl fløj væk

waves that leave me out of reach
breaking on your back like a beach
will we ever live in peace?

på landevejene vil jeg vandre

jeg finder altid et sted at være, 
jeg skal nok finde vej til dig.

kaster grus mod rudens glas, 
han hvisker: Det er så koldt herude, 
har du i sengen en ledig plads?

hun spurgte: Hvem banker på min rude 
længe før, det er blevet lyst? 
  
Jeg er ikke som de andre ...

gå til dør\'n og luk mig ind, 
for jeg har vandret i mange dage 
gennem regn, pløre, frost og vind. 
  
Hun lukked\' døren op med glæde 
- modtog ham med kys og kram, 
og hun løfted\' sit sengeklæde 
for at dele sin seng med ham. 
  
Jeg er ikke som de andre ...

jeg må op og gå min vej, 
og alt vil være så skønt derude,

rundt omkring dig og for oven.

Halløjsa kom så med, så tager vi afsted
der er så fuld af sjov, inde i en skov.

Der er massevis af fugle, du høre nok en gøg
og du ser måske en ugle.

Halløjsa kom så med, så tager vi afsted
der er så fuld af sjov, inde i en skov.

Hør engang hver ganske stille, HR Spætte banker på
og en sangfugl slår en trille.

Halløjsa kom så med, så tager vi afsted
der er så fuld af sjov, inde i en skov.

Ræven jager mus og fugle, men hvis den møder dig
gemmer den sig i sin hule.

Halløjsa kom så med, så tager vi afsted
der er så fuld af sjov, inde i en skov.

Det kan være du ser hjorte, de springer raskt afsted
en to tre så er de borte.

Halløjsa kom så med, så tager vi afsted
der er så fuld af sjov, inde i en skov.

Se det lille egern hoppe, en lille festlig fyr
oppe mellem trærenes toppe.

Halløjsa kom så med, så tager vi afsted
der er så fuld af sjov, inde i en skov.

Hør et pindsvin det kan snøfte, men det har pigge på
så lad hellere være og løfte det.

Halløjsa kom så med, så tager vi afsted
der er så fuld af sjov, inde i en skov.

that Papa never worked a day in his life?
And Mama, some bad talk going around town

Talked about saving souls and all the time leaching.

Spent most of his life chasing women and drinking.

No, I don't want your sympathy, the fugitives say
That the streets aren't for dreaming now
And manslaughter dragnets and the ghosts that sell memories,
They want a piece of the action anyhow
Go waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me

And you can ask any sailor, and the keys from the jailor,
And the old men in wheelchairs know
And Mathilda's the defendant, she killed about a hundred,
And she follows wherever you may go
Waltzing Mathilda, waltzing Mathilda,
You'll go waltzing Mathilda with me

And it's a battered old suitcase to a hotel someplace,
And a wound that will never heal

Jeg sad ved andet bord i rækken det var tredie skoledag
Em7                      Gm7              C7
Vi var begyndt 8. klasse vi havde samfundsfag
D                          H7
Pludselig gik døren op der stod hun hun var ny
        E7                           A7
Hun hed Mona jeg blev hul og tom jeg troede jeg blev syg
          D                       G
Hun havde store brune øjne og hun gik i cowboytøj
Em7                             Gm7                 C7
Hendes hår var langt og lyst og hun var ikke særlig høj
       D                           H7
Når vi mødtes midt i døren var det li'som jeg fik stød
        E7                            A7
Det var egentlig ikke væmligt for jeg syn's jo hun var sød
            D                          G
Men det var mer' end jeg husker at hun spurgte om mit navn
         Em7                                Gm7             C7
Jeg ble' stum og dum og kold og klam da jeg stammed' Jesper Ravn
D                                H7
Ugen efter vidste klassen alt og helvede brød løs
         E7                 A7
De råbte du er varm på Mona gi' hend' nu det kys.

Men min stemme er i overgang mit hår er helt forkert
    D                         H7
Jeg går i det forkerte tøj og så er jeg genert
   Em7
Åh Mona Mona Mona
        A7
Hvornår kommer den dag
             Em7
Hvor jeg tør ta' din hånd

Hvor vi ka' stikke af sammen.


Mona tog det pænt hun ku' se jeg havde det skidt
Vi talte sjældent sammen og det hjalp faktisk lidt
Drillerierne holdt op alting virkede normalt
Men inde i mig selv var der stadig noget galt
Så en dag kom læ'ren ind og gav os den besked
At vi sku' på lejrskole op i nordsjælland et sted
Jeg ka' huske vi sku' mødes under uret klokken ti
Jeg kom først i nye støvler allersidste skrig
Det ble' larmet på perronen Hans og Mogens sad og røg
Der var en dejlig lugt af tjære og en masse larm og støj
Vi grined' i kupeen alt var fint så ble' jeg bleg
For jeg så at Mona sad li' til venstre for mig

Og min stemme...

De sa' ta' dog lidt på Mona nu i sidder så tæt
Men så gik døren op vi sku' vise vor' billet
Jeg var rød i ho'det så jeg tog en supermand
Han fløj igennem byen i et helt afsindigt land
Tre banditter skød ham ned med et stykke kryptonit
Da jeg så kalle skrev mit navn med et stykke kridt
Så tegned' han et hjerte jeg for op og stak ham en
Mona sad og smilede til en fyr der hedder Sten
Jeg blev helt forvirret og de andre skreg af grin
Jeg styrted' ud i gangen og jeg tænkte dumme svin
Hele toget rasled' imens sjælland for forbi
Jeg skulle være glad men jeg var trist fordi

Og min stemme...

Om aft'nen var det ild i pejsen lærerne gav vin
Vi sang med på smukke Charlie du ved den med Gasolin
Helle spilled' guitar det lød ikke særlig godt
Så vi var ni der gik til stranden månen var så flot
Jeg gik bagest lidt alene jeg ku' dufte Mona's hår
Henrik spilled' op han var jo osse sytten år
Vi satte os i sandet jeg ku' mærke den der vin
Men pludselig ku' jeg osse mærke Monas hånd i min
Hun lagde sit hoved på min skulder jeg fik pludselig selvtillid
Jeg glemte alt om tøj og bumser i et stykke tid
Det første kys var dejligt og der var ingen drilleri
Vi kom sammen flere måneder nu er det forbi

jeg vil ikke nikke ende som dig
og stå her på gaden som et andet kvaj
du kan tro nej det ikke mig åh nej åh nej
Men i skolen der gik det skidt
han ku' ikke sidde stille og lærte for lidt
han havde kviksølv i numsen som sin daddy
og salig onkel Stage - nu står han og råber:

Køb bananer...
Sådan cirka siger pojken

I've been putting it off for a while,
But it's harder by now, 'cause the truth is so clear
That I cry when I'm seeing you smile.
So goodbye, so long, the road calls me dear
And your tears cannot bind me anymore,
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes
Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone.

Every time that I tried to tell
that we'd lost the magic we had at the start,
I would weep my heart when I looked in your eyes
And I searched once again for the spark.
So goodbye, so long, the road calls me dear
And your tears cannot bind me anymore,
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes
Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone.

I can see by your eyes, it's time now to go
So I'll leave you to cry in the rain,
Though I held in my hand, the key to all joy
Honey my heart was not born to be tamed.
So goodbye, so long, the road calls me dear
And your tears cannot bind me anymore,
And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes
Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone.

We're the kings of swing 
And we're chosen to rule 
The deans of clean inside the cool school 
We're the chiefs of relief 
Contained by wild beasts 
The finesse of the West, the masterpiece of the East 
Hah, the boss of course 
As the lord of our fort 
The ones with the platinum vocal chords 
We're the science of desire 
With a magical mic 
The monarch of the dark in the night alright 
We advertise 
And specialize 
In the exercise and we'll energize 
The young ladies thighs 
Cause all the fly guys 
Nature's to rise right before their eyes 
We're the Earl of the world 
And the Air of flair 
The Duke of dare, the Mayor of debonaire 
Got fine, drink wine 
Can dance and dine 
Got a first class female oh so fine

Hey baby, whatever you doin right girl 
I just want you to always be easy, and keep on shakin that thing 
and I want you -- swingin it swingin it swingin 
Tell me how now 
Like dy-na-mite before it blows 
Who needs a band when the beat just goes -- boom! 

He's Grandmaster, he cuts faster 
We're the Furious, serious, and ever so mysterious 
Five that's rockin the house 

And everybody say PLAY (PLAY) 
Say PLAY (PLAY) well OK!

Don't you worry bout a thing Raheem'll do you right 
I'm a mint that's fresh huh, a woman's pet 
There ain't a thing in the world that I can't get 

In the history books or the picture show 
It's the golden voice on your radio 
I'm the rapper never printed voice is solid gold 
I'm playin the role, they call me Kid Creole 

And I'm the, the Romeo, of the nasty show 
All the ladies in the place, to my house we go 
Freakin in the den just to make you move 
Cause I'm Cowboy, and I got the groove

That he wanna know your favorite jean 
Is it Jordache? (NO!) Gloria Vanderbilt? (NO!)

Could it be Calvin Klein? (NO!) Then what is it? (?????)

Got waterbed sets in my limousine 
And everytime I'm seen I got to be clean 
I tour around the world, to make the people dance 
And here's a little message for the ladies in France 
?Huh huh, zmapel, Melle Mel? [I have no idea what Melle Mel says] 
?Ah dome mal lamate mademoiselle? 
?Done wa sing, done marseis? 
?Done wa rik no dees!? 

I'm seein this girl that I just adore 
I'm seein this girl that what I never saw before 
The way she was swaying and doing the swing 
I had to let her know just about my thing 
I'm the M, R, N E-Double S 
Come on, ah fly girl, and put me to a test 
and I'll rock you, until you give me the rest 
I keep on it, until you start to fess 

Raheem, in your life, what more can you ask 
I bet you can't think of a greater task 
I make my light shine on your cloudy days 
You can surf if you want to, on my waves 
I caress your soft body on those mellow nights 
A continuous thing, to the morning light 
It's reality, it's not a dream 
It's nothing less than the best when it's from Raheem 

Now it's my turn so understand 
That I'm the Kid Creole, and I'm a ladies man 
I don't, have a lot of women hangin on my steez 
Only one fine lady that you better believe 
I say Annette's her name, and that's the truth 
I give a lot of things up, before I turn her loose 
It's just her, and that's simple and plain 
And that's the only way I run my game 

Well I'ma, Cowboy and I'm the real McCoy 
I'm chocolate all over like an Almond Joy 
Bowlegged cool brother and you will agree 
On top of the world for the ladies to see 
Gonna hip gonna hop gonna rock the spot 
Gonna make everybody wanna rock rock rock 
Gonna do it to the East, wanna do it to the West 
Gonna make you relax right upon your chest 

Grandmaster Flash, is willing and able 
He's the king of the cuts on two turntables 
He's the GRAND, GRAND, the master man 
He's so nice with his hands he don't need no band 
Rocks 45's, and 33's 
Rocks boys men women and young ladies 
He can slice so precise it's almost fun 
And he makes better love than a mick makes money

Of cigarettes and magazines
And each town looks the same to me
The movies and the factories
And every stranger's face I see
Reminds me that I long to be

I'll play the game and pretend
But all my words come back to me
In shades of mediocrity
Like emptyness in harmony
I need someone to comfort me.

Dirt in her hair and her clothes in rags

Carrying her home in two carrier bags

In the all night café at a quarter past 11
The same old man is sitting there on his own
Looking at the world over the rim of his teacup
Each tea lasts an  hour and he wanders home alone

Have you seen the old man outside the seamans mission
Memory fading with the  medal ribbons that he wears
In our winter city the wind cries a little pity
For one forgotten hero and a world that doesn´t care","2025-03-23 19:54:11","2025-03-23 19:54:11",163

On the third day he took me to the river
He showed me the roses and we kissed
And the last thing I heard was a martyr word
As he knelt above me with a rock in his fist

On the last day I took her where the wild roses grow
She lay on the bank going light as a thief               (?)
And I kissed her goodbye, said all beauty must die
And I leant down and planted a rose between her teeth

Han fandt sig en pige af dem med lilla ble,
runde briller, Kalsø-sko og 2 CV,
fik lidt hæklede lapper på sit cowboytøj,
og lånte et par meninger fra venstre fløj 

Så gik de lidt og flippede rundt,
røg lidt pot og leved' mikro-makro-sundt,
på at læse brugt' de ikke megen tid,
for de skulle jo også komm' hinanden ved. 

Sådan gik det nu i'n 3-4 år
og så gik det sådan som det ofte går:
Med en studiegæld på en betragtelig sum
started' Kresten på Hjørring Seminarium! 

Efter fire år blev Kresten degn
og sku' til at skaffe sig til dag'n og vej'n
og han søgte her og der og ned' og opp'
men hvorend han søgte var der ingen job. 

Uden job og med en gæld så stor
flytted' Kresten så atter hjem til gamle mor.
Han ka' lig' hold' sig selv med tøj og kost
for han har en tjans i Tolne som reservepost.

Du behøver ingen skillinger,

Hoping for love to find a new voice
The song that needs singing has already been sung before

Like a rhinestone cowboy
                                             G
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo

Like a rhinestone cowboy
                                                  G
Getting card and letters from people I don't even know
                           F
And offers comin' over the phone


Well, I really don't mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There'll be a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

Got to have done some evil deed,
Got to have your own harem when you come in the
door,
Got to play your heart until your lips bleed.

To which a scoundrel clings

Steal a lot and they make you a king.

Lonely mother gazes out of a window
Looking at a sun that she just can\'t touch
If at any time he\'s in a jam she\'ll be by his side 
But he doesn\'t realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain\'t helping at all 
\'Cause he can\'t seem to keep himself out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how 
Another body lying cold in the gutter.
     
CHORUS:
Don\'t go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes like you used to
I know that you\'re gonna have it your way or nothing at all 
But I think you\'re moving too fast
     
Little precious has a natural obsession 
For temptation but he just can\'t see
She gives him lovin\' that his body can\'t handle 
All that he can say is baby it\'s good to me
One day he stops and takes a look in the mirror 
But he doesn\'t recognize his own face
His health is failing and he doesn\'t know why 
Three letters took him to his final resting place.

Vi skal ud at se på damer, ud at ha' en lækker steg -

For der er damer nok på skærmen, og transmission af fødselsveer,
så jeg har ikke noget behov for sex, men jeg er meget ivrig seer.

Shedding off one more layer of skin.
Keeping one step ahead of the persecutor within.

Chorus

You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds,
Manipulator of crowds,
You're a dream twister.
You go to Sodom and Gomorrah, but what do you care?
Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister.
A friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame.
You look into the fiery furnace - see the rich man without any name.

Chorus

Well the book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy,
The law of the jungle and the sea,
Are your only teachers.
In the smoke of the twilight --- on a milk-white steed,
Michelangelo indeed could have carved out your features.
Resting in the fields far from the turbulent space.
Half asleep neath the stars with a small dog licking your face.

Chorus

Well the (mafia?) man stalkin' the sick and the lame,
Preacher man seeks the same,
Who'll get there first is uncertain.
Matchsticks and water cannons --- teargas, padlocks,
Molotav cocktails and rocks,
Behind every curtain.
False-hearted judges dyin' in the webs that they spin.
Only a matter of time til night comes steppin' in.

Chorus

It's a shadowy world - skies are slippery grey,
A woman just gave birth to a prince today,
And dressed him in scarlet.
He'll put the priest in his pocket - put the blade to the heat,
Take the motherless children off the street,
And place them at the feet of a harlot.
Oh Jokerman you know what he wants.
Oh Jokerman you don't show any response.

But tonight the sweet devil, sweet devil's got my soul


when will this aching pass
when will the night be through
I want to hear the breaking glass
I only feel the steel of the red hot truth
And I'd do anything to get it out of my mind
I need some insanity that temporary kind
tell me how will I ever be the same
when I know that woman is wispering you name

And their memory's like a train
        G              A7                   D
You can see it getting smaller as it pulls away
        D                  A7
And the things you can't remember
         D
Tell the things you can't forget

Are those dreams or are those prayers?

For a calendar girl

The boys just dive right off the cars and into the street
    D                 A7
And when they're on a roll
            D
She pulls a razor from her boot
      G                                A7
And a thousand pigeons fall around her feet

So put a candle in the window
D
And a kiss upon his lips
       G                A7                D
As the dish outside the window fills with rain
D                A7
Just like a stranger
         D
With the weeds in your heart
    G                                A7
And pay the fiddler off 'till I come back again

She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam I guess
But I used a little too much force
We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out west
Split up on a sad dark night
Both agreeing it was best
She turned around to look at me
As I was walking away
I heard her say over her shoulder
We'll meet again some day
On the avenue
Tangled up in Blue

I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that  much
And one day the axe just fell
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I was lucky to be employed
Workin' for a while on a fishing boat
Right outside of Delacroix
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind
I seen alot of women
But she never escaped my mind
And I just grew
Tangled up in blue

She was working in topless place
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept looking at the side of her face
In the spotlight so clear
And later on when the crowd thinned out
I was just about to do the same
She was standing there in back of my chair
Said to me Don't I know your name
I muttered something undernaeth my breath
She studdied the lines on my face
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces
Of my shoe
Tangled up in blue

She lit a burner on the stove
And offered me a pipe
I thought you'd never say hello she said
You look like the silent type
Then open up a book of poems 
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
>From the thirteenth century
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burning coal
Pourin' off of every page
Like it was written in my soul
From me to you
Tangled up in blue

I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air
Then he started dealing in slaves
And something inside of died
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside.
And when the bottom finally feel out
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keeping on
Like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue

So now I'm going on back again
I got to get to her some how
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenters wives
Don'ty know how it all got started
I don't know what they're doing with their lives
But me, I'm still on the road
Headin' for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point of view
Tangled up in blue.","2025-03-23 19:54:11","2025-03-23 19:54:11",181

tør't mor mit ansigt af for snot
snot af at vræle fordi jeg vil fortælle
om en ponyhest jeg lige ha' set
en ponyhest der legede med en dreng
men de gamle fatter ingenting
Det eneste de gamle er kommet for at se er
Tårnspringer Thomsen fra Tåstrup

Vi trak videre med strømmen som et bette fnug støv
det eneste jeg ku' se var voksne bukserøve
så blev jeg løftet op mod himlens tag
op på fars skuldre på en sommerdag
der var stribede markiser så langt jeg ku' se
og søndagstøj med rigtige mandfolk i
en mand stod og råbte kom og gi' en skærv
når borgmesteren løfter de syv små dværge
eller døvstumme Conny der forsøger at danse
til Poul Dissing der forsøger at synge imens
Vi venter på tivolis hovedattraktion
Tårnspringer Thomsen fra Tåstrup

Der var folk helt fra Sæby og Aalborg af
vi stod og måbede med nakken lagt tilbage
trykket til jorden af det vanvittige syn
af tårnspringermasten højt over byen
da tusind års stilhed endelig lettede
der blev fuldstændig stille da en højttaler skrattede:

- Damer og Herrer i den her bette by
er i klar til en mand af verdensry
om et øjeblik vil han begynde at kravle op
for at springe ud fra mastens top
oven i købet verdens eneste mand
der ka' nøjes med at lande i en bette spand vand
30 meter ned uden sikkerhedsnet
for jer sætter han sit liv på et bræt
i tre dage har han pure nægtet at springe
simpelthen på grund af for kraftig vind
- ja gu' er det farligt – næsten uforsvarligt
vi må ha' fuldstændig ro – ta' nu godt imod
Tårnspringer Thomsen fra Tåstrup

Så i det samme kom han ud af sit skur
som et sjældent dyr der kommer ud af sit bur
sammen med ham kom en bette fed mand
der virkede nervøs som var det ham der sku' springe
det var svært at høre hvad den bette mand sagde
men jeg tror jeg vil spørge ham hvis jeg ser ham en dag
Tårnspringer Thomsen virkede nærmest lidt skræmt
og den bette fede mand virkede osse beklemt
de pegede på flaget i mastens top
folk begyndte at råbe kom nu, hop!
Et flertal der kræver er umuligt at stoppe
så Tårnspringer Thomsen begyndte at kravle op

Han hed faktisk Jamie Jamieson
men det var der ingen der ku' sige derfra hvor jeg kom
det var fuldstændig ligemeget hvad han hed
det eneste vi vil' se var en mand der faldt ned
vi kaldte ham Tårnspringer Thomsen fra Tåstrup

Ude over havet var himlen sort
Tårnspringer Thomsen stod ved himmerigs' port
som engang en håndværker på sit kors
stod han stille lidt med armene spredt ud på tværs
som engang en håndværker I Palæstina
var han halvvejs en helt
halvvejs noget man ku' grine af
Så var der en der hviskede nu springer han vist
mor rettede lidt på den gamles slips
så holdt hun vejret med åben mund
jeg så hun tog fat i den gamles hånd
hendes knoer blev hvide idet hun fik fat
og han løsnede på slipset hun lige havde sat
og idet samme fra toppen af sin 30 meter mast
sprang Tårnspringer Thomsen fra Tåstrup

Vi så ham flyve som en udstrakt pil
skudt ud af himlen som af Wilhelm Tell
han voksede i os jo mer' han faldt
men halvvejs nede var der noget der gik galt
han baskede med armene som om han fortrød
mens han nærmede sig jorden med en hvislende lyd
han landede i bassinet som han sku'
men han ramte osse jorden så den runger endnu
da Rimmern' kirke ringede solen ned
omfavnede himlen det sidste skrig
fra Tårnspringer Thomsen fra Tåstrup

En stilhed jeg mindes fra før jeg blev født
så stille som de bønner han aldrig fik bedt
ham der solgte pølser fik sig banet vej
en tyk bette mand i netundertrøje
vi så ham dykke ned i det bette bassin
og da han langt om længe kom op igen
bar han i favnen den livløse bylt
af Tårnspringer Thomsen fra Tåstrup

Så skrattede en højttaler med en besked
- Damer og Herrer i den her bette by
må vi be' om et bifald som aldrig før
men der var ingen der klappede
ikke så vidt jeg ku' høre
nu hvor det hele for længst er forbi
- altså bagklog kan man selvfølgelig sige
at en mand der som ham sprang i skæbnens vold
mer' end nogen havde fortjent sit bifald
- og så alligevel
den eneste der helt sikkert ingenting ku' høre
var Tårnspringer Thomsen fra Tåstrup

Der blev sagt at Poul Dissing sku' synge et sæt mer'
jeg må lige ha' spurgt Poul om han ka' huske hvad han gjorde
- snart poppede popcornmaskinen igen
en sort dag i bizness men the show must go on
i avisens dækning den følgende dag
var det ham der solgte pølser der var billeder af
hans penge blev våde da han prøvede på at redde
Tårnspringer Thomsen fra Tåstrup

Jeg reddede mig en lussing i stedet for en is
ved at sige vi var udvalgt blandt tusindvis
til at se en tårnspringer slå sig ihjel
selvfølgelig noget lort - men han valgte det jo selv
og hvem kan forstå når man kun er en dreng
der findes mennesker med en djævelsk trang
til at blive husket som mere end sin far
hvem så end hans far han var
Måske den første der sprang ud engang
blandt Tårnspringer Thoms'ner fra Tåstrup

Flyv bette fugl ligeså tosset du vil
det var det du fik dine vinger til
vi andre må nøjes med at forstå
vi blev sat på jorden for at kravle og gå
vi skal fortsat slubre i lunken grød
vi ska' nøjes med at kratte for det daglige brød
og at den slags krumspring skal gå galt
var vi mange her i byen der godt ku' ha' fortalt
Hvis vi ellers ha' fået en chance for at snakke'

Way out in New Mexico a long time (D) ago
When a (G) man\'s only friend was his (D) own forty- (G) four

In old Silver City he went to the bad
Way out west with a knife in his hand
At the age of twelve years he killed his first man

Songs about Billy their boy bandit king
Before this young manhood reached its sad end
He\'d a notch on his pistol for twenty one men

It was on one black night that poor Billy died
He said to his friends, \""I\'m not satisfied
There\'s twenty one men that I\'ve put bullets through
And sheriff Pat Garrett\'s gonna make twenty-two\""

Well, this is how Billy the Kid met his fate
A big moon was shining and the hour was late
Shot down by Pat Garrett, Silver City\'s best friend

576,"Kys hinanden","Verden er vild! Alting er skørt! 
Bibelens ti bud blir slet ikke hørt! 
Det som vi mangler er selveste 
bud nummer elleve
Og det bud har jeg fundet på,
og det lyder i korthed som så:

Kys hinanden!
Kærligt og blidt på panden.
Kys er jo tegn på fordragelighed. 
Det'n behagelighed!
Og min svagelighed!
Altså: Kys hinanden!
For det vil ærgre Fanden.
(Men) englene jubler, og guderne ler, 
hvis vi kysser hinanden lidt mer.

Prøv nu at se, hvad der vil ske,
hvis man går ind på min fikse ide. 
Første eksempel skal være
to fjendtlige hære,
som kampberedt står opmarcher't,
men så pluds'lig blir der kommander't: 

Kys hinanden!
Bare gå li' på manden.
Så går det frem gennem pigtråd og hegn 
mod en fjendtlig kaptajn,
som si'r: Kom så min eg'n!
Og så op på skansen
og kys dem helt fra sansen.
Når de har kysset det første geled, 
bryder fjend'n samm'n og trygler om fred.

Flere og fler' kører i bil,
men i trafikk'n ser man aldrig et smil. 
Der skal man bare fornærme
og helst krølle skærme.
Men hvis I vil følge mit bud,
så rul ned og stik ho'derne ud.

Kys hinanden!
Spar jeres banden.
Ham der kør' rundt i en gammel Chevrolet 
og med murerkasket 
han kan osse ha' ret!
Og såfremt en Opel
kører lidt mindre nobel'
og torpederer dig midt i et kryds
så stig ud og gi' manden et kys.

Disse ord, som står over dom-
huset, dem må vi jo ha' lavet om.
Det er vist noget i retning
af denne her sætning:
Med lov skal man bygge et land.
Men der burde ha stået sådan:

Kys hinanden!
La' vær' med at slå på panden.
Bissen i Nyhavn blir ydmyg og blid.
Ellers kommer politi 't.
Og begynder kysseri't
Så må hver en sagfør'
begynde at rense tagrør.
Der vil aldrig bli' brug for en lovparagraf -
hvis man skal kysse sin modpart som straf

Med dette bud mener jeg sel'
verden blir hyggelig og ideel.
Det skal lanceres med ynde.
Lad os her begynde.
For det er en mægtig ide.
Og vi starter når jeg siger tre!
(En - to - tre - og så ...)

Kys hinanden!
Kys nu ham hustyrannen!
Og når De nu kommer hjem til Dem sel', 
husk så på min appel,
så' den højaktuel!
Ta' og kys hinanden!
(Så) sti'r barometerstanden.
Og barometret blir stå 'nde på smukt -

And time is running backwards
And so is the bride.

Ring them bells St. Peter
Where the four winds blow,
Ring them bells with an iron hand
So the people will know.
Oh it's rush hour now
On the wheel and the plow
And the sun is going down
Upon the sacred cow.

Ring them bells Sweet Martha,
For the poor man's son,
Ring them bells so the world will know
That God is one.
Oh the shepherd is asleep
Where the willows weep
And the mountains are filled
With lost sheep.

Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Who will judge the many when the game is through.
Ring them bells, for the time that flies,
For the child that cries
When innocence dies.

Ring them bells St. Catherine
From the top of the room,
Ring them from the fortress
For the lilies that bloom.
Oh the lines are long
And the fighting is strong
And they're breaking down the distance

And why I'll never know.
Honey, you're lying when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you.
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than go on living without you.
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then make them bring the curtain down.

We got in a fight over Tennessee
Pulled our guns and he fell with a thud
And I rode away on a Tennessee Stud

I whupped her brother and I whupped her Pa

Little horse colt playing round the door
I loved the girl with the golden hair
And the Tennessee Stud loves the Tennessee Mare

But every time you just let me down.
Come on be a man about it, you'll survive,
true that you can't work it out alright.
Tell me, yesterday did you know,
I'd be the one to let you go, and you know...

Back about eighteen and twenty-five

I left Tennessee very much alive
     A

One of her brothers was a bad outlaw
A                                
I wrote a letter to my Uncle Fudd
                       E         A   
And I rode away on the Tennessee Stud

    A                  G        A   
The Tennessee Stud was long and lean
    D                        C         E    
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
A                                    
He had the nerve and he had the blood
                             E         A   
There never was a horse like Tennessee Stud

Drifted on down into no man's land
Across the river called the Rio Grande
Raced my horse with the Spaniard's foe
Til I got me a skin full of silver and gold

Me and the gambler, we couldn't agree
We got in a fight over Tennessee
Pulled our guns and he fell with a thud
And I rode away on a Tennessee Stud

{chorus}

I rode right back across Arkansas
I whupped her brother and I whupped her Pa
I found that girl with the golden hair
She was riding on a Tennessee Mare

Pretty little baby on the cabin floor
Little horse colt playing round the door
I loved the girl with the golden hair
And the Tennessee Stud loves the Tennessee Mare

Og slå køteren ihjel

Der hvor frosten den står stille
Og en mand han holder ord
Der hvor ørnen han suser
Over fiskens ryg

Med dingalows blik

Ælt det sammen til noget bla'r
I kan vælge et billigt bestik
Hvis I bare ka' la' mig være
For hør vildhunden han bjæffer
Han er bankernes skræk
Jeg bli'r nødt til at finde ham

Så stopper jeg hånden i lommen

Gi' mig fri nu til middag
Og vink mig så farvel

Der hvor bjæleren bor
Der hvor frosten den står stille
Og hvor en mand han holder ord

I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for long, long years 
I've stolen many a man's soul and faith
I was around when Jesus Christ 
had His moments of doubt and pain
I made damn sure that Pilate washed 
his hands and sealed his fate

[Chorus]
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, 
but what's puzzling you, is the nature of my game

I stuck around St. Petersburg 
when I saw it was time for a change
I killed the Tzar and his ministers, 
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a gen'ral's rank, 
when the blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name, 
but what's puzzling you, is the nature of my game

I watched with glee while your kings and queens, 
fought for ten decades for the gods they made
I shouted out ""Who killed the Kennedys?"", 
when after all it was you and me
So let me please introduce myself, 
I am a man of wealth and taste
And I lay traps for troubadours, 
who get killed before they reach Bombay

[Chorus]

Just as every cop is criminal, 
and all the sinners, Saints
As heads is tails, just call me Lucifer, 
'cause I'm in need of some restraint
So if you meet me, have some courtesy, 
have some sympathy and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse, 
or I'll lay your soul to waste
Pleased to meet you, hope you guess my name,

People pissing on the stairs, you know they just don't care 
I can't take the smell, I can't take the noise 
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice 
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back 
Junkie's in the alley with a baseball bat 
I tried to get away, but I couldn't get far 
Cause the man with the tow-truck repossessed my car 

Chorus: 
Don't push me, cause I'm close to the edge 
I'm trying not to loose my head 
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder 
How I keep from going under 

Standing on the front stoop, hangin' out the window 
Watching all the cars go by, roaring as the breezes blow 
Crazy lady, livin' in a bag 
Eating out of garbage piles, used to be a fag-hag 
Search and test a tango, skips the life and then go 
To search a prince to see the last of senses 
Down at the peepshow, watching all the creeps 
So she can tell the stories to the girls back home 
She went to the city and got so so so ditty 
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own 

Chorus: 
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder 
How I keep from goin' under 

My brother's doing fast on my mother's T.V. 
Says she watches to much, is just not healthy 
All my children in the daytime, Dallas at night 
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight 
Bill collectors they ring my phone 
And scare my wife when I'm not home 
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation 
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station 
Me on King Kong standin' on my back 
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac 
Midrange, migraine, cancered membrane 
Sometimes I think I'm going insane, I swear I might hijack a plane! 

Chorus: 

My son said daddy I don't wanna go to school 
Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool 
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper 
If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper 
I dance to the beat, shuffle my feet 
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps 
Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny 
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey 
They push that girl in front of a train 
Took her to a doctor, sowed the arm on again 
Stabbed that man, right in his heart 
Gave him a transplant before a brand new start 
I can't walk through the park, cause it's crazy after the dark 
Keep my hand on the gun, cause they got me on the run 
I feel like an outlaw, broke my last fast jaw 
Hear them say you want some more, livin' on a seesaw 

Chorus: 

A child was born, with no state of mind 
Blind to the ways of mankind 
Got a smile on you with these burning tooth 
Cause only god knows what you go through 
You grow in the ghetto, living second rate 
And your eyes will sing a song of deep hate 
The places you play and where you stay 
Looks like one great big alley way 
You'll admire all the number book takers 
Dogpitchers, pushers and the big money makers 
Driving big cars, spending twenties and tens 
And you wanna grow up to be just like them 
Smugglers, scrambles, burglars, gamblers 
Pickpockets, peddlers and even pan-handlers 
You say I'm cool, I'm no fool 
But then you wind up dropping out of high school 
Now you're unemployed, all null 'n' void 
Walking around like you're pretty boy Floyd 
Turned stickup kid, look what you done did 
Got send up for a eight year bid 
Now your man is took and you're a May tag 
Spend the next two years as an undercover fag 
Being used and abused, and served like hell 
Till one day you was find hung dead in a cell 
It was plain to see that your life was lost 
You was cold and your body swung back and forth 
But now your eyes sing the sad sad song 
Of how you lived so fast and died so young

and in a manger cold and dark, Mary's little boy was born.

Jeg har plejet min tørst, min go?e gamle tørst,

Jeg har brugt alt mit sølv, sammen med damer der drak øl,

Jeg er en træt gammel dreng ... 
  
Hvor er mine sko? De go?e gamle sko,

tæerne sprællede frit så de ku? få lidt solskin.

                                                  D 
hvor de dyrkede hamp og frihedskamp,mod en fæl diktator
                                           A    
der blev Carlos født og mens han sad i sin gynge
                                                 D  
ku' han høre sin far og mor gå rundt i hytten og synge

         A                  D

Carlos voksede op og byggede slotte i sand[A]et
og blev kold og varm når han så Camina gå i vand[D]et
hun var smuk som en drøm,og li' så brun som en ne[A]ger
og der var op til flere derfik sjove ideer 
når hun var ude at spadse[D]re

A                                G                D
Carlos lærte Camina den sang han hørte da han var spæd
Bm              F#m    Em            A
Carlos han sang for, Camina hun sang med

OMK

Som en steppebrand spredtes sangen til folket
og 1.påskedag i et blodigt slag blev diktatoren dolket
det var Carlos selv der fik tyranen knaldet
og nu er det don Carlos og Camina der åbner karnevallet

OMK

Hverken gods eller guld kan gøre bager til slagter
og selv en donkeymand går ikke i land fordi han får en trator
Carlos går endnu og bygger slotte i sandet 
og kan ikke forstå at de bli'r taget igen af tidevandet

Men oppe i bjergene står der en dreng ved sin faders grav
han synger samme sang som Carlos fik i arv

Her er en historie om en dreng, der hedder Quang
       F           C                D7            G
Han er 7 år, bor i Thailand og hans arbejdsdag er lang
         F              C              D7           G
Han står tidligt op om morgenen og går meget sent i seng
    F                C                 G            C
For Quang har nok og se til, skønt han bare er en dreng
 
     C              G               F            C
Hver morgen klokken kvart i fem går Quang alene ned
       F            C               D7              G
Gennem tornekrat og tidsler, til en båd ved flodens bred
   F             C                     D7         G
Og vandet det er mørkt og koldt, men familien har gæld
       F            C               G             C
Så han dykker efter perler, for det meste uden held

Quang har ingen far mer' og hans mor er meget syg
   F              C          D7           G
Så Quang må tjene penge inde i den store by
    F              C           D7               G
Han står i larm og bilos dagen lang i al slags vejr

Men han må bruge sine tænder, for han har ikke nogen tang
 
 
        F             C                     G               C

Oh down to the river we’d ride
 
[Verse]
Then I got Mary pregnant  And man, that was all she wrote
And for my 19th birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat
We went down to the courthouse  And the judge put it all to rest
No wedding day smiles, no walk down the aisle
No flowers, no wedding dress

[Verse] 
I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company
But lately there ain't been much work on account of the economy
Now all them things that seemed so important
Well mister they vanished right into the air
Now I just act like I don't remember, Mary acts like she don't care
 
[Bridge] 
But I remember us riding in my brother's car
her body tan and wet down at the reservoir    
At night on them banks I'd lie awake
And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take
Now those memories come back to haunt me
They haunt me like a curse
Is a dream a lie if it don't come true    
Or is it something worse

Made up of these three words that I must say to you.

No harvest moon to light one tender August night.
No autumn breeze, no falling leaves,
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies.

No giving  thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring.
But what it i-i-i-is, though old, so new.
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do.

hvad har vi så gjort at vi har det så herligt
i arkivets stabler af hæfter
hvisker blækket til arkene: ""Jeg elsker dig kærligt""

vil jeg plukkes af vinden der bor i din park

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack,
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track.

Strummin' with the rhythm that the drivers made.
When people passed him by they would stop and say,
'oh, my but that little country boy could play'

His mother told him, 'someday you will be a man,
You will be the leader of a big ol' band.

Will hear you play your music when the sun go down.
Maybe someday your name'll be in lights,

Jeg vil ikke slås med bisser, jeg vil så og ikke slå.
Selv de rødeste radiser kan man roligt lide på.
Der er nok af danske helte som er danske hele dag’n,
og går rundt og spænder bælte, mens de råber; Fy for Fan.

Tiden går og tiden hverver store mænd til mandig dåd.
Jeg reserven blandt reserver bryder ofte ud i gråd.
Jeg får nerver og migræne blot jeg skær’ mig på en dolk,
og vil hell’re slå min plæne, end slå løs på pæne folk.

Livet er en dejlig gave, jorden er en herlig jord.
der er øller i min mave, der står krokus på mit bord.

Han cykler hurtigt gennem stefansgaderegnen lige nu
Han vil ikke sige, hvad han har tænkt
Hun kan ikke gætte, hvad han har tænkt
Nej, han står og laver mælkehjerter, plat og baristasmart

Du ligner lidt en gammel, kønsstereotypisk hønemor
Og sådan kan hun ofte tænke, mange forhold er
Vi lever alt for travlt og egoistisk sammen, det er trist
Hun har aldrig bollet med andre før
Han har aldrig fattet, hvad ansvar er
Men de elsker sikkert hinanden højt alligevel,

I regntøj springer Carla, Ibrahim og Clive

Se, nu kigger solen bag skyen frem

Byen ligger stille hen
som en fisk med bugen
i forurenet vand.
Jeg lukker øjnene
for at være sammen med dig.

Igen og igen
og tonerne blev til et langstrakt refræn
et plot, en fortælling, en popmelodi
godnatsange brudt af sirenernes skrig
vi følte os som en luftløs ballon.
 
En luftløs ballon
en endeløs sætning, helt kæntret og tom
jeg hjemsøges tit af idéer om flugt
men latteren tegner dit ansigt så smukt
du strækker din krop mens solen står op
 
Mens solen står op,
så brygger vi kaffe og drikker en kop
og når vi blir fanget i hverdagens støj
så ruller vi øjne og deler en smøg
så strander vi der hvor ømheden er
 
Hvor ømheden er
marcherer vi tappert med velviljens hær
en kærlighed tyndslidt og helt desperat
kun båret af løfterne, stålsat og klart
et dirrende nu mit søvnige du
 
Mit søvnige du
mit drama er langt, min fornuft er itu
og når jeg blir bange og når jeg blir vred
så sænk mine skibe og skænk mig din fred
jeg øjner en kyst og snart blir det lyst
 
Og snart blir det lyst
så tag mig for givet, det virker så tyst
fortabt er jeg stadig trods årenes gang
og synger med tak denne kærlighedssang
fordi det sku’ ske vi mødtes i sne","2025-03-23 19:54:11","2025-03-23 19:54:11",20

But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

 I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
 Tell me baby do you recognize me?
 Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

 ""Merry Christmas!"" I wrapped it up and sent it (whispered)
With a note saying: ""I love you!"", I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

 Hiding from you and your soul of ice
 My God, I thought you were someone to rely on

A man undercover but you tore him apart (To-o-ore   me  apa-art) Ooh-hoo

Sometimes I see how the brave new world arrives,

Seems to me now that the dreams we had before
are all dead, nothing more than confetti on the floor.

what lies waiting down the line,
in the end of...eighty-nine?

[Verse 1: Stayin' Alive - Bee Gees]
Bb7           Ebm        Ab7
Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
Db7                Gb
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk
Cm             B                Bb7
Music loud and women warm, I've been kicked around
Ebm
Since I was born

[Verse 2: Virtual Insanity - Jamiroquai]
Ebm                          Ab
And nothing's going to change the way we live
Db7                       Gb
'Cause we can always take but never give
Cm                               B       Bb
And now that things are changing for the worse, see        ohh 

[Pre-chorus: Stayin' Alive - Bee Gees]
Ab                  Ab          Gb
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me
Ab                     Ab          Gb
Somebody help me, yeah 

[Chorus: Virtual Insanity - Jamiroquai]
B       D       Ebm        Abm
Futures made of virtual insanity now
B          Bb       Ebm            Ab          Gb
Now always seem to, be governed by this love we have
B            Bb          Ebm
For useless, twisting, of our new techno – logy
B                Bbm          Db
Oh, now there is no sound for we all live underground
 
[Verse 3: Stayin' Alive - Bee Gees]
Well now, I get low and I get high
And if I can't get either, I really try
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes
I'm a dancin' man and I just can't lose 

[Verse 4: Virtual Insanity - Jamiroquai]
And nothing's going to change the way we live
'Cause we can always take but never give
And now that things are changing for the worse, see   ohh

[Verse 1]
Em         C    D          G
 I want to live, I want to give
Em           C           D        G
 I've been a miner for a heart of gold
Em            C         D         G
 It's these expressions - I never give
Em                            G
 That keep me searching for a heart of gold
C                      G
 And I'm getting old
Em                       G
 Keep me searching for a heart of gold
C                      G
 And I'm getting old
 
[Interlude]
 
[Verse 2]
I've been to Hollywood, I've been to Redwood
I've crossed the ocean for a heart of gold
I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold
And I'm getting old

 Keep me searching for a heart of gold

 You keep me searching and I'm growin' old
Em7                      D        Em
 Keep me searching for a heart of gold

856,"Når havene står stille","[Omkvæd]
    G                 Gsus4       Gsus2
Jeg tænker på dig når havene står stille
      C
- med spejlblankt vand
G          Cmaj   A7.      D - Dsus4 - D
og når jeg ser en Fjällräv hat
   Dsus2            Hm           C      C/h C/a
Du kender det når naturen gør en lille
   Gmaj           D7          G      Gsus9
Så hold om mig en stjerneklar nat

[Vers 1]
   Gmaj          C            G
Et lykketræf, et fund af dimensioner 
G              Em          A7   D7
Højskolen stod lysegrønt i fuld flor
Dsus4        G          C
Møllesøen og mu-sikkens toner
    C      Am        D7
var alt og bas i det kor
   Hm7             Cmaj
Vi trillede ned af bakken
       Hm7           C
tog en dukkert eller to
    Hm7              C       
Her var sgu noget om snakken
Em7   /h     D7 - /c - /h - /a
Noget der ku gro

[Omkvæd]

[Vers 2]
Bare tæer i græsset, solen skinner
Og fluen kilder på din tå
I denne have svæver mange minder
og ofte går tiden i stå
Der har været bump på vejen
Nu er vi landet så fint et sted
Min skat kom og grib pagajen
Se, jeg sejler med

[Omkvæd]

858,"Skulder ved skulder","Interlude: C# G#/C C# G#/C
 
       C#             G#/C
Du har ingen rynker i panden
           C#                 G#/C
Og ikke en eneste bekymring i verden
        C#                      G#/C
Du tror ikke på gud eller nogen anden
         C#             G#/C
Og du er ikke bange for smerten
 
[Interlude] 
 
Og du får mig til at grine
mest af mig selv
Og du får livet til at ligne
Noget vi godt kan klare alligevel
 
[Chorus 1]
        F#                    A#m                     G#
Og hvis nogen skulle komme og påstå at du drikker for meget
        F#                   A#m               G#/G# G#/C  G#/D#
Så skal jeg nok sørge for at blive fuldere end dig
       F#                      A#m               G#
Og når nogen står og siger til dig at jeg er for meget
                F#              A#m         G#/G# G#/C  G#/D#
Så står du lige her skulder ved skulder hos mig
 
[Verse 3]
Og siger at
Jeg er som et lys i vinden
Jeg siger at du er størst
Eller mindst lige så stor som Anne Linnet
Imens ingen af os dør af tørst
 
[Chorus 1] 
 
Og nu gider jeg faktisk
Godt at blive over 60
Hvis du også stadig er her
På en bænk ved søerne glad og tilpas
Vi drikker øl og ryger smøger og er
 
[Chorus 2]
Og hvis du skulle dø før mig fordi du ryger lidt for meget
Så vil jeg sidde hver sommer ved søerne og tænke på dig
Og hvis jeg går og synes at livet bliver lidt for meget
Så sidder du lige her som en engel på skulderen af mig
 
Helt uden rynker i panden
Og ikke en eneste bekymring i verden","2025-05-28 16:42:11","2025-05-28 16:46:23",407
